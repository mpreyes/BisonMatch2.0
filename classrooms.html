          Development screenings conducted twice a year, once in the beginning of the school year and once in the late spring, to assess student progress and growth.
          This allows teachers to assess skill levels and target specific developmental deficits for each child.
          Daily communication is sent home with each child regarding activities, behavior, sleep routines, etc.

        <b>Curriculum:</b>
        <p>
          Baby Time:  Family Enrichment Program Infant Curriculum is designed to capitalize on how a baby's daily routines can serve as the basis of learning, throughout the day.
          Activities are centered around daily routines, as well as on special play time, talking time, and cuddling routines.
          Baby sign gestures are introduced in this program to promote early and healthy communication.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Classrooms utilize a multi-sensory approach to learning, incorporating sensory activities daily.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In regards to discipline, first and foremost, a positive-praise theme is used in order to foster good behavior within the classroom.
          Redirection is also used consistently in our classrooms.
          If behavior issues persist, the teachers work closely with the parents and our therapy staff to create an individualized behavior management/modification plan for the child.

        <b>Curriculum:</b>
        <p>
          Innovations: The Comprehensive Toddler Curriculum advocates thinking about and planning for everything that can, by the nature of the setting, contribute to child development and the teacher's relationship with the child and the family.
          Everything involved in the curriculum works together to benefit the child. This curriculum is comprehensive -- encompassing all aspects of growing and learning; embracing the inter-relationship among the child's interest and response, child development, the child's family context and culture, and the reactions and interactions of the adults and other children.
          Curriculum is aligned with the Tennessee Early Learning Developmental Standards, and is enriched whenever possible to ensure activities are age and developmentally appropriate. Sign language is incorporated in the Inchworm curriculum to expand early communication, lessen frustration, and aid in speech development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The classroom utilizes a multi-sensory approach to learning, incorporating sensory activities daily.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In regards to discipline, first and foremost, a positive praise theme is used in order to foster good behavior within the classroom.
          Redirection is also used consistently in our classrooms.
          If behavior issues persist, the teachers work closely with the parents and our therapy staff to create an individualized behavior management/modification plan for the child.

          Development screenings conducted twice a year, once in the beginning of the school year and once in the late Spring, to assess student progress and growth.
          These screenings also allow teachers to assess skill levels and target specific developmental deficits for each child, as well as, allowing teachers to ensure that each child is prepared for kindergarten.
          Nationally normed kindergarten readiness test administered during the summer before kindergarten.
          Daily communication sent home on each child regarding activities, behavior, sleep routines, etc.

        <b>Curriculum:</b>
        <p>
          The DLM Early Childhood Express is a holistic, child-centered program that nurtures each child by offering carefully selected and carefully sequenced learning experiences, based on the latest neuroscience research.
          It provides materials and ideas to foster the social-emotional, intellectual, and physical development of children, while nurturing the natural curiosity and sense of self that can serve as the foundation for a lifetime of learning.
          The DLM Early Childhood Express is developed with the whole child in mind, providing opportunities to develop concrete skills through experiences with music, art, storytelling, and teacher-directed lessons that, in addition to skills development, emphasize practice and reflection.
          There is a heavy emphasis on kindergarten readiness skills such as letter and number recognition, handwriting skills, phonological awareness, and pre-reading skills.
        </p>
        <br>
        <b>Supplementary Curriculum:</b>
        <p>
          Handwriting Without Tears; a curriculum that focuses on skills beginning with pre-writing concepts and following through developmental stages to writing letters and numbers.
          Handwriting is taught every day by the teachers, with a staff occupational therapist coming in the classroom to supplement the learning through hand-strengthening activities and fine motor practice.

          Age-appropriate technology is available, providing relevant skills for future classrooms in learning how the technology works, how we can gather information using the internet, and providing other learning-based games for the classroom.
